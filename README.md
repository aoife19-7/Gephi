Gephi Report
Gephi is powered by the application *Netvizz*. This allows users to export information about their Facebook friends and the connections between them. Gephi offers a range of tools that help displays the network of their personal Facebook friends. The nodes displayed on the graph help represent information. The larger nodes presented on the graph tells the user that they are more connected across the network such as **Eavan Hennessy**. The bridges are a lot stronger in comparison to connections such as **Billy Shanahan** and **Conor O Reilly.**


It is accessible to filter your Facebook friends to a minimum size for information in order to be read more accurately. I eliminated the friends I felt would have a lot more bridging between them to help portray exactness on the network graph. The aim of the graph is to include as much clarity as possible. Nodes and edges can be modified through the filtering system. It was easier to filter friends on my Facebook network in order for the data to be displayed accessibly. Nodes can be identified through a range of various colours. I used red and large font for the labels to distinguish the representatives of larger networks. I then used blue to classify the minor connections between the clusters such as **Cian Boyd** and **John Foley**.

My main aim when creating this graph was to follow *'Schiderman Netvizz Nirvana'* to obtain the highest degree of clarity for my graph. This also showed the strong and weak bonds between my various connections on Facebook. It was striking to study the links between my mutual friends that I had not realised before, conjointly with the users that had no connections with the rest of my Facebook friends. There are various tabs which offer tools such as *Label adjusting* which helps the labels overlapping on the network graph. This was useful as many of the names seemed to extend along other names. Presentation is key when working with *Gephi*. The degree option provides different styles to choose from. I used *'Force-Alas 2'* as I felt it was the most informative format. I also felt that it helped improve legibility for the user.


The *Ranking* tab provides ranges of layout helping the user to present their graph visually, *in-degree* managed to do this successfully. *In-degree* format allowed the range to be altered offering a drop down option for the minimum and maximum size range. The *Ranking™* tab also helps to calculate the weight of each node allowing the edges to create two nodes together intertwining them to a larger community. The diamond placed in *Ranking* helps represent the size of different nodes. The font and font size of the labels can be easily modified through *Node labels* in the preview tab. The labels must be of proportional size as the large labels is a default setting in the *Gephi* programme. A disadvantage of the software is that the graph window is easy to exit from making it difficult for the user to study their graph. By adding colours to the graph it can help identify the separate connections and clusters of networks. Due to the insufficiency of â€˜Facebook friendsâ€™ I decided it would be more beneficial to filter the names by clicking on the *topology* folder which helped minimise the amount of names displayed. I felt that this added clarity to my graph.*'Modularity'* also helps achieve this clarity, it creates an improved decomposition.

The resolution came to '1.0' which helped me define my graph as a smaller community of networks. The Network graph showed the four central people on my Facebook network. They are an evident example of *eigenvector centrality* as they promote the trend of evolving numerous connections. **Betweenness** is the shortest paths between any two individuals. The names labelled in red font represent the names that have the most paths running through them.
** *-Eavan Hennessy 
    -Niamh Emmett 
    -Eilis McFarlane**. 
  They help to connect each cluster together. They may not be able to exemplify betweenness as they remain to be unacquainted with the 'outsiders' on the network. They still in theory have broken networks due to their unfamiliarity with certain users.*(Patrick Harte)*.These nodes of greater centrality also lack in providing an influence because of their inefficient betweenness centrality.
